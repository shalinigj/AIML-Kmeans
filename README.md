Depression - K means 
Objective:

To determine if there is a relationship between higher levels of black and white thinking and higher levels of self-reported depression in psychiatric patients hospitalized for depression.Also apply K means clustering and assign groups for model prediction

Context:

It is common for people who tend to think of their reality as a series of black and white events to suffer from depression. Psybersquare, Inc. describes a few examples of this way of thinking by saying that those who suffer from this way of thinking think that
"If things aren't 'perfect,' then they must be "horrible." If your child isn't "brilliant" then he must be 'stupid.' If you're not 'fascinating' then you must be 'boring.'"
This can be a difficult way to live since those suffering from this way of thinking may never feel that their reality is “good enough”.

Data Sources:
The data used for this study is from the Ginzberg data frame which is based on psychiatric patients hospitalized for depression. Data is from the book Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition by Fox, J. (2008). The dataset includes three variables - simplicity (black and white thinking), fatalism, and depression. The data also includes these variables each adjusted by regression for other variables thought to influence depression.
"Black and white thinking" is referred as "Simplicity"
